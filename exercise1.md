# What is Babel and Why Is It Important?

Have you ever seen a tweet like [this](https://twitter.com/mathias/status/1355065237532258305) and found yourself disappointed when browser support wasn't available for these brand new features in your Javascript codebase quite yet? Enter Babel, a nifty compiler for Javascript. It lets anyone write modern Javascript while its plugin ecosystem converts all unsupported Javascript into a form of Javascript that browsers the world over can understand. It’s become so ubiquitous that you may not even have been aware that you’ve been using it, as popular frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/customizing-babel-config) and [React](https://medium.com/swlh/the-role-of-babel-in-react-dbcf78c69125) use Babel under the hood to make sure the code they're delivering to browsers runs everywhere. Some of the [largest companies and organizations in the world](https://babeljs.io/en/users.html) also use Babel to make sure their developers continue to write cutting edge Javascript while staying compatible with browser standards. 

One of the key features that makes Babel so great is that instead of having to manage [polyfills](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill), you can [configure Babel](https://web.dev/serve-modern-code-to-modern-browsers/) to automatically keep your codebase up-to-date and only make absolutely necessary adjustments based on the browser support you've defined. The ease with which Babel is able to minimize the workload while allowing new features to work with browsers that might be behind is characteristic of the tool. Javascript evolves faster than browsers can release support for new features, and it doesn’t seem to be slowing down any time soon, which also means Babel will continuously be the crucial and perfect companion for your Javascript codebase.

**Justification and Explanation:** I chose Babel because new Javascript frameworks and use cases are being invented every day. As those frameworks diverge, the common language that they are all required to speak is one that every browser can understand. So although build tools aren't discussed as often as new frameworks or languages, they underpin much of the technology in the developer ecosystem that seems to just work without much thought, and as such, will continue to become even more valuable with the growth and scale of technology.
