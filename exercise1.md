# What is Babel and Why Is It Important?

If have ever seen a tweet like [this](https://twitter.com/mathias/status/1355065237532258305) and have wanted to start using these brand new features in your Javascript codebase, you may have been disappointed when you realized that the browser support wasn't available for them quite yet or that your codebase needed to support browsers that wouldn't be able to utilize those features for quite some time. That's where Babel comes in. Babel is a compiler for Javascript that lets you write modern Javascript while, by using it's plugin ecosystem, converting that Javascript into Javascript that can be understood across browsers. Instead of having to manage [polyfills](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill) and remove them when browsers start to support those features natively, you can [configure Babel](https://web.dev/serve-modern-code-to-modern-browsers/) to automatically keep your codebase up-to-date and only make adjustments when absolutely necessary based on the browser support you've defined. 

Originally released in September of 2014 (and called 6to5 at the time), Babel has grown from a project supported by a [single individual](https://babeljs.io/blog/2016/12/07/the-state-of-babel) to a large open source project maintained by a team of contributors. Some of the [largest companies and organizations in the world](https://babeljs.io/en/users.html) use Babel to make sure codebases are compliant with the latest browser standards while ensuring their developers can take advantage of all the new features the language has to offer. Even if you are not using Babel directly in the configuration of your build tools, popular frameworks such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/customizing-babel-config) and [React](https://medium.com/swlh/the-role-of-babel-in-react-dbcf78c69125) use Babel under the hood to make sure that the code they're delivering to browsers runs everywhere, no matter how the developers working with these frameworks choose to set up their Javascript.

As Javascript continues to change and evolve faster than browsers can release support for new features, having a middle layer like Babel that allows new features of the language to work with browsers that might be a bit behind is going to continue to be crucial. So the next time you're disappointed that a particular feature of Javascript isn't ready for use in production, check and see if Babel just might be what you need to make that a reality.

**Justification and Explanation:** Out of the list of the potential projects, I chose Babel because new Javascript frameworks and use cases are being invented every day and as those frameworks diverge, the common language that they all have to speak in the end is one that every browser can understand. So even though build tools don't get as much press and aren't talked about as often as new frameworks or languages, they underpin much of the technology that "just works" in the developer ecosystem and will continue to become even more important in the future.
