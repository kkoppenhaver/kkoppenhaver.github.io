# How to Get Started on GitHub

Whether you're working on projects by yourself and want to stop having to save files as `file1.bak` whenever you want to test a new change or you're working with a big team and want an easier way to collaborate on your codebase, you're in the right place! If you're not already familiar with how to use git, you'll want to go through a [quick tutorial first](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/).

## Step 1: [Sign up](https://github.com/signup) for a free GitHub account

## Step 2: Create a repository (optional)

If you're going to use GitHub to host code that _you've_ written, you need to [create a repository](https://github.com/new), which is where your code will live on GitHub. Once you've done that, you can follow the instructions to push code to your new repo. 

## Step 3: Make your first contribution!

If you're looking to contribute to an existing project instead, head over to their repository and see if they have any specific  instructions for contributors first.

## What next?

Once you've mastered the basics, learn how to [create issues and pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request), [how to use GitHub on larger teams](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-git-and-github-in-a-team-like-a-pro/), and [browse for a project](https://github.com/explore) to jump in on!
