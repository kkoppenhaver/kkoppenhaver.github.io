# Getting Started with GitHub

Ready to stop saving files as `file1.bak` or want to collaborate more easily with your team? It’s time to get on GitHub, and it’s really easy to get started!

## Step 1: [Sign up](https://github.com/signup) for a free GitHub account

This is the easiest step in the process, we promise.

## Step 2: _Maybe_ create a repository

If you're going to use GitHub to host code that you've written, you need to [create a repository](https://github.com/new), Follow the instructions to push code to your new repository, and see where your code will live on GitHub. 

## Step 3: Make your first contribution!

If you're looking to contribute to an existing project instead, head over to their repository and see if they have any specific  instructions for contributors first.
